FarCry Core Framework
====

FarCry Core is a web application framework based on the ColdFusion language (supporting Adobe ColdFusion and Railo engines). FarCry Core comes with FarCry CMS, a popular content management solution built with FarCry Core.

It's the ideal platform for building bespoke or tailor made online publishing solutions.

## Current Status

**FarCry 6.3.x** (codename: Seedy Nelly) is the latest stable branch of FarCry. You can [download a distribution from the main website](http://farcrycore.org/download).

[Installation help](https://farcry.jira.com/wiki/display/FCDEV60/FarCry+6.x+Installation) available in the WIKI but the distro installer is pretty straight forward.

**FarCry 7.0.x** (codename: Shiny) is currently in development and due for release November 2013. You can get it by forking and checking out **trunk**.

## Forking, Commits, Pull Requests

We follow GitHub's standard recommendations for pull requests:
  https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

The only caveat is that all submissions must continue to cede copyright to "Daemon Pty Limited", the corporate custodian of the code base.

Simple "pulls" will go through almost immediately.  More complex stuff might spark a bit of discussion on the pull request itself, prior to going into the code base.

Fork now! Pull at will ;)
