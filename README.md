## Forking, Commits, Pull Requests

We follow GitHub's standard recommendations for pull requests:
  https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

The only caveat is that all submissions must continue to cede copyright to "Daemon Pty Limited", the corporate custodian of the code base.

Simple "pulls" will go through almost immediately.  More complex stuff might spark a bit of discussion on the pull request itself, prior to going into the code base.

Fork now! Pull at will ;)
